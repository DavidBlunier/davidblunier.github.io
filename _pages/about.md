I am a linguist trained as a philosopher and literary theorist in Lyon and Geneva. I am mostly interested in the [semantics and pragmatics of natural languages](https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002545), which basically means that I am interested in how languages express meanings, and how these meanings are affected, shaped, and enhanced by general reasoning patterns pertaining to human cognition. Most of my reasearch is about anaphora, that is, about how languages allows us to encapsulate and retrieve information across sentences and discourse units, using dedicated elements such as [pronouns](https://semanticsarchive.net/Archive/Dg4YzMwY/buring.HSK.pronouns.07.pdf), names, and even [complete silence](https://home.uchicago.edu/merchant/pubs/ellipsis.revised.pdf). I am also greatly interested in understanding and modelling the role of context, that is, what can be uttered when and by whom in a given conversational setup.

I am also greatly interested in sign language linguistics; I have been working on [sign language role shift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tWMG7wqFY) with co-authors [Giorgia Zorzi](https://giorgiazorzi.com//) (Bergen) and [Evgeniia Khristoforova](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/k/h/e.khristoforova/e.khristoforova.html?cb) (Universiteit van Amsterdam), with whom I have investigated the various patterns of anaphora involved in role shift in Sign Language of the Netherlands (NGT).

I completed my PhD dissertation about indexicality and anaphora in reported speech under the supervision of [Isabelle Charnavel](https://sites.google.com/site/isabellecharnavel/home) (Geneva) and [Yasutada Sudo](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucjtudo/) (University College London).

My other interests are calisthenics, opera and cinema, not necessarily in that order.
