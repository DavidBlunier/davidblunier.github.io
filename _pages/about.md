I am PhD researcher and teaching fellow in linguistics at the University of Poitiers. As a linguist, my main interests lie in [semantics and pragmatics of natural languages](https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002545), which basically means that I am interested in how languages express meanings, and how these meanings are affected, shaped, and enhanced by general reasoning patterns pertaining to human cognition. I recently completed the PhD program in
linguistics at the University of Geneva, where I recently defended my dissertation under the supervision of [Isabelle Charnavel](https://sites.google.com/site/isabellecharnavel/home) (Geneva) and [Yasutada Sudo](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucjtudo/) (University College London). My dissertation is about indexicals, those natural language expressions that refer to elements of the utterance context; more precisely, it focuses on their behavior in speech reports in both spoken and signed languages. I have been working on indexical shift, a phenomenon that describes first and second person pronouns being interpreted anaphorically in complex clauses, as well as logophoric pronouns.

Concomitantly, I have been working on [sign language role shift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5tWMG7wqFY) with co-authors [Giorgia Zorzi](https://giorgiazorzi.com//) (Bergen) on Catalan Sign Language, and [Evgeniia Khristoforova](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/k/h/e.khristoforova/e.khristoforova.html?cb) (Universiteit van Amsterdam), with whom I have investigated the various patterns of anaphora involved in role shift in Sign Language of the Netherlands (NGT). Other topics I'm interested in include quotation, presuppositions, coâ€‘ and pro-speech gestures, and the role of alternatives and competition in anaphora.

My other interests are, among many, calisthenics, opera, poetry and cinema, not necessarily in that order.
