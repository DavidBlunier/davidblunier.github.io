What else?
======
During my free time, I entertain various hobbies like gymnastics, calisthenics, yoga, dancing and lyrical singing; I am fond of opera, which I enjoy both off‐ and onstage, having been regularly cast as an actor and/or dancer in various productions in Geneva and Lausanne. My last show as a comedian was Claudio Monteverdi’s [*Il ritorno d’Ulisse in Patria*](https://www.olyrix.com/articles/production/6570/le-retour-d-ulysse-dans-sa-patrie-opera-monteverdi-27-fevrier-2023-critique-compte-rendu-geneve-biondi-bergman-manuel-hioco-joosten-woodbridge-padmore-mingardo-colorado-lozano-milhofer-mancini-zilio-bridelli-varnier-delaere-ratia-yi-meinert-galante) at the Grand Théâtre de Genève, by Antwerp collective FC Bergman. I have also been working as an intern assistant‐stage director for Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui's production of Mozart’s *Idomeneo* (Grand Théâtre de Genève, 2024), and as a stage manager for Mariame Clément's production of Donizetti's *Roberto Devereux* (Grand Théâtre de Genève, 2024).
