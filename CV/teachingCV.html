## About Me
I am a formal linguist specialized in semantics and pragmatics, which means that I am interested in the cognitive capacity that allows us to produce and understand meaningful units pairing concepts with (sequences of) sounds, and the reasoning preferences that enhance these symbolic units in order to make human communication extremely efficient. What makes me a linguist is that, unlike (neuro)psychologists, I study these aspects of human cognition through their manifestation in the grammar and lexicon of the world's languages.
  
Through my research and teaching, I am deeply invested in innovative pedagogy and accessible academic communication. I thrive in multilingual environments and bring a multidisciplinary foundation to my work, with training in literature, philosophy, and psychology.
